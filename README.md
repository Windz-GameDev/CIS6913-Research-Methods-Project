# Game Development Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains research and analysis focusing on game development, particularly examining the impact of Procedural Content Generation (PCG) and other AI/ML technologies. The project aims to explore the differences in development time, cost, performance, innovation, and user satisfaction between games that utilize PCG and those that do not.

## Repository Structure
- `game_data.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset used for analysis, featuring details on various games including development time, cost, and other relevant metrics.
- `run_analysis.py`: The Python script for conducting the statistical analysis and generating data visualizations.
- `CIS6913 - Aaron Goldstein - Assignment 4 Deliverable.pdf`: A detailed document explaining the research methodology, literature review, and the study's findings.
- `result_images/`: A directory containing the visualizations generated from the analysis, illustrating the statistical comparisons.

## Visualizations
The script generates several key visualizations to represent the data analysis:
- Development Time Comparison
- Development Cost Analysis
- Game Performance Ratings
- Innovation in Game Development
- User Satisfaction Ratings

These visualizations are saved in the `result_images/` folder.

## Getting Started
To run the analysis:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the libraries `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scipy`.
3. Execute `run_analysis.py` to perform the analysis. The script reads data from `game_data.csv` and outputs the results as visualizations in the `result_images/` directory.

Refer to the `CIS6913 - Aaron Goldstein - Assignment 4 Deliverable.pdf` for an in-depth understanding of the research and findings.
